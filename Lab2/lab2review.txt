1. 

Evidence looks ok.

You could have joined the screenshots for better organization.


2.

Sufficient knowledge of the terms primary key, candidate key, and superkey.

Google.com is not a valid source, and even if it was, it is incorrectly cited.
Avoid using it again, in this and any other classes, or cite it properly.


3.

By -null- you mean -not null-? Also there are some missing parenthesis.

You might have the wrong concept of what -nullable- means. Can a student have
no name?

You did not discuss what fields were -nullable-.


4.

The ``frist normal form'' has nothing to do with primary keys. Please check
your notes and the textbook Chapter 6.1.

The ``access rows by content only'' rule explanation is wrong. Please check
your notes or the book Chapter 6.1.

The ``all rows must be unique'' rule is wrong. Please check your class notes or
Chapter 6.1 of the textbook.

You have several typos.
