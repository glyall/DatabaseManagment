SQL statements are readable
Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct SQL statements


6. List all data for products not in Dallas or Duluth that cost US$1 or more.

Incorrect output
- It seems like you did not read the correct instructions for this query. Read
  it again, please.


8. List all data for orders in February less than US$500.

Incorrect SQL statement
- It seems like you forgot a semicolon! Your query produces an error!
   ERROR:  syntax error at or near "Select"
   LINE 1: ... from orders  where mon =('feb') and dollars <500 Select *  ...
                                                                ^

In general: 

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries.
