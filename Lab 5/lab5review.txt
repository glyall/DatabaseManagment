Correct output for some queries
Mostly correct queries
Mostly correct SQL statements
SQL statements are somewhat readable

Recommendations: 
 To improve your readability, write queries like this:
  SELECT DISTINCT pid
  FROM orders
  WHERE aid IN (SELECT aid
                FROM orders
                WHERE cid IN (SELECT cid
                              FROM customers
                              WHERE city = 'Dallas'))
  ORDER BY pid DESC;     -- < notice the correct indentation here


5. Show the names of customers who placed at least one order through an 
   agent in their own city, along with those agent(sâ€™) names.

Incorrect output
- You are joining the wrong tables.


6. Show the names of customers and agents living in the same city, along 
   with the name of the shared city, regardless of whether or not the 
   customer has ever placed an order with that agent.

select c.name, a.name, c.city
from customers c
inner join agents a
   on c.city = a.city;

Incorrect output
- You are missing the shared city.



In general: 

- Please do not use tabs for indentation. Use spaces instead.

- Test all your SQL statements.

- Make sure you read all the instructions for queries really well.

- Make sure you have semicolons at the end of each of your queries. 
  Your query produced an error!

- Make sure your name is somewhere in the .sql file.
